                        I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks Landscaping Limited for the incredible
                        work
                        they
                        did for
                        my yard in the Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work diligently to complete my yard in a
                        timely
                        fashion,
                        they were very nice and polite and went out of their way to ensure everything that I asked for
                        was
                        done.
                        They
                        were extremely patient with the issues raised regarding some of the neighbours concerns. They
                        were
                        also
                        always
                        asking me if there was anything more they could do which made me feel that they genuinely wanted
                        to
                        do
                        their
                        best work. The landscaping crew as a whole was beyond fantastic and extremely polite and
                        professional.
                        In
                        particular, I want to thank Matt & Jimmy (who worked on the fence and deck) for being
                        outstanding
                        employees.
                        They not only fixed and addressed all of my concerns but they went out of their way to make sure
                        everything was
                        completed at a high standard. For example, I had mentioned a concern about the grass (even
                        though
                        they
                        were not
                        the ones who put it in) and the next day they brought new sod in and replaced the bad parts. I
                        would
                        also like
                        to extend my gratitude to Chad, as he too went above and beyond to organize everything I asked
                        for.
                        From
                        putting
                        up with all of my phone calls, to following up with all my changes; he made sure our new yard
                        and
                        deck
                        was taken
                        care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how much I appreciate all of the crew’s hard
                        work,
                        and
                        how
                        impressed I am with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.

                    <div class="testimonial"> Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping happen. I had
                        no
                        clue of how to set up
                        my
                        yard, but
                        they came and gave me an awesome plan and executed. The city had put requirements on my property
                        that
                        needed to
                        be met. I was unsure on how to meet the requirements and stay within my budget. After a brief
                        meeting
                        with a
                        park representative they had created a plan that to fulfill the requirements and had booked a
                        time
                        to
                        finish the
                        job. A great thing when you are spending so much money is to see the crew actually working
                        swiftly
                        and
                        not
                        taking long breaks. Park’s guys worked straight until dark each day to finish the job. I would
                        totally
                        recommend
                        Green Thumb Landscaping to anyone. In fact, I did recommend them to a neighbour down the street.
                        He
                        went
                        with
                        Park because they were able to deliver a prompt and professional service. Thank you Green Thumb
                        Landscaping for
                        a job well done!

                        and
                        this has been by far
                        one
                        of the
                        best experiences! They met or exceeded expectations every step of the way. The planning process
                        was
                        fun,
                        the job
                        started the day we’d planned for and the crew was fantastic, working full days until they were
                        done,
                        and
                        touching base with me whenever there were decisions to be made (no matter how minor). We had a
                        patio
                        area put in
                        for our fire pit, added walkways, pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding area and they levelled
                        the
                        lawn and
                        put down new sod. The work was top notch. Even more telling of the high level of professionalism
                        is
                        the
                        care
                        they put into follow up. They’ve contacted us, come out to the house to take a look after the
                        fact
                        and
                        actually
                        asked for feedback to help them do better in the future. I wish all companies cared about their
                        craft as
                        much as
                        the team at Green Thumb Landscaping Ltd. When we’re ready to tackle the front yard we will
                        definitely be
                        working
                        with them again and we would highly recommend them to others 🙂
